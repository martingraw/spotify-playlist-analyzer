## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spotify-playlist-analyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify API (Required)

**Step-by-step Spotify Developer Setup:**

1. **Create Spotify Developer Account**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Log in with your Spotify account (create one if needed)

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click "Create an App"
   - Fill in the details:
     - **App Name**: "Playlist Analyzer Pro" (or any name you prefer)
     - **App Description**: "Advanced Spotify playlist analysis tool"
     - **Website**: Leave blank or add your domain
     - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3001` (for development)
   - Check the boxes to agree to terms
   - Click "Create"

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - In your new app dashboard, you'll see:
     - **Client ID**: Copy this (you'll need it)
     - **Client Secret**: Not needed for this frontend app
   - Click "Edit Settings" to add more redirect URIs if needed

4. **Configure Redirect URIs**
   - In "Edit Settings", add these redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3001` (for development)
     - `http://localhost:3000` (backup)
     - Your production domain when you deploy (e.g., `https://your-app.netlify.app`)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your Spotify credentials:
```env
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_from_spotify_dashboard
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `your_actual_client_id_from_spotify_dashboard` with the actual Client ID from your Spotify app
- The redirect URI must exactly match what you set in your Spotify app settings
- Never share your Client ID publicly in production (use environment variables)

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action!
